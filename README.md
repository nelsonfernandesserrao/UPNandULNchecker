The Department for Education sets out the restrictions and formulae for calculating (and validating) Unique Learner Numbers (ULNs) and Unique Pupil Numbers (UPNs).

This Python code draws upon the published validation guides (uploaded to this repository for reference) to validate a CSV file of ULNs and UPNs.

Optionally, temporary UPNs can be validated. Temporary UPNs should only be in use during the time in which an educational institution is searching for a pupil's permanent UPN.
